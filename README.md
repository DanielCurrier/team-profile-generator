# Description
This program is a test of my knowledge regarding Object Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development. With this program , the user will be able to  generate profiles for team members for any  given web development project, and generate an html file rendering that information onto the page. Although this was by far the biggest challenge to date , I can safely say that  I have created a product that I can confidently place on my profile. Thank you for reading, and please continue to the usage guide for more info!
## Installation
Please download this repository and place it in whatever folder you deem fit.
## Instructions
To use this program, open up your command line interface of choice and change your directory location to where this application resides in your system. Once there, type in 'node index.js' to run the program. A series of prompts will appear in your CLI, answer them to the best of your ability. If you would like to create another employee, simply reply with "Y" in the final prompt to continue the process anew. The previous input will be saved and appended to an array, so don't worry! Your progress is saved ðŸš€.

The program will then run a series of functions to take in the information given to render a series of employee cards onto an HTML file located in the "assets" folder of the repository. To see the result, simply view the file in the internet browser of your choice. 

If you would like to see how the employee class objects were tested, change directories to __tests__ and run "npm test (filename)" in the CLI to see if they pass the tests provided!
